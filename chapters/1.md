# Introduction

Welcome to the Remy and Bruce show. We're two developers who have been playing with HTML5 since Christmas 2008 experimenting, participating in the mailing list, and generally trying to help shape the language as well as learn it.

Because we're developers, we're interested in building things. That's why this book concentrates on the problems that HTML5 can solve, rather than an academic investigation of the language. It's worth noting, too, that although Bruce works for Opera Software, which began the proof of concept that eventually led to HTML5, he's not part of the specification team there; his interest is as an author using the language.

## Who's this book for?

No knowledge of HTML5 is assumed, but we expect you're an experienced (X)HTML author, familiar with the concepts of semantic markup. It doesn't matter whether you're more familiar with HTML or XHTML doctypes, but you should be happy coding any kind of strict markup.

While you don't need to be a JavaScript ninja, you should have an understanding of the increasingly important role it plays in modern web development, and terms like DOM and API won't make you drop this book in terror and run away.

Still here? Good.

## What this book isn't

This book is not a reference book. We don't go through each element or API in a linear fashion, discussing each fully and then moving on. The specification does that job in mind-numbing, tear-jerking, but absolutely essential detail.

What the specification doesn't try to do is teach how to use each element or API or how they work in the context of each other. We'll build up examples, discussing new topics as we go, and return to them later when there are new things to note.

You'll also realise, from the title and the fact that you're comfortably holding this book without requiring a forklift, that this book is not comprehensive. Explaining a specification that needs 900 pages to print (by comparison, the first HTML spec was three pages long) in a medium-sized book would require Tardis-like technology--which would be cool--or microscopic fonts -- which wouldn't.

# In search of the Spec

Because the HTML5 specification is being developed by both the W3C and WHATWG, there are different versions of the spec.

[http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) is the official W3C snapshot, while http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/ is the latest editor's draft and liable to change.

For the WHATWG version, go to [http://whatwg.org/html5](http://whatwg.org/html5) but beware: this is titled "HTML5 (including next generation additions still in development)" and there are hugely experimental ideas in there such as the `<device>` element. Don't assume that because it's in this document it's implemented anywhere or even completely thought out yet. This spec does, however, have useful annotations about implementation status in different browsers.

There's a one-page version of the complete WHATWG specifications called "Web Applications 1.0" that incorporates everything from the WHATWG at [http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/) complete.html but it might kill your browser as it's massive with many scripts.

Confused? [http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ](http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/FAQ#What_are_the_various_versions_of_the_spec.3F) lists and describes these different versions.

Geolocation is not a WHATWG spec and lives at [http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/](http://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/)

## What do we mean by HTML5?

This might sound like a silly question, but there is an increasing tendency amongst standards pundits to lump all exciting new web technologies into a box labeled HTML5. So, for example, we've seen SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) referred to as "one of the HTML5 family of technologies," even though it's an independent W3C graphics spec that's 6 years old.

Further confusion arises from the fact that the official W3C spec is something like an amoeba: Bits split off and become their own specifications, such as Web Sockets or Web Storage (albeit from the same Working Group, with the same editors).

So what we mean in this book is "HTML5 and related specifications that came from the WHATWG" (more about this exciting acronym soon). We're also bringing a "plus one" to the party— Geolocation—which has nothing to do with our definition of HTML5, but we include simply for the reason that it's really cool, we're excited about it, and it's part of the New Wave of Exciting Technologies for Making Web Apps.

# Canvas

If the video element is the poster boy of HTML5, the canvas element is definitely the Han Solo of HTML5. It's one of the larger parts of the HTML5 specification, and in fact the canvas API, the 2D drawing context, has been split into a separate document, though the canvas element itself is still part of the official HTML5 spec.

The canvas element provides an API for two-dimensional drawing--lines, fills, images, text, and so on. The API has already been used in a huge range of situations, including (interactive) backgrounds to websites, navigation elements, graphing tools, full-fledged applications, games, and emulators. Who knew Super Mario canvas-based games would open the eyes of so many developers!

If you think back to the days of the version of MS Paint that came with Windows 95, you can imagine some of the functionality of canvas. In fact, Paint has been replicated using the canvas element, as shown in Figure 5.1. Applications that aim

to become full-fledged vector drawing suites (Figure 5.2) are popping up all over the Web (whereas Scalable Vector Graphics [SVG] would be a better choice--see the "When to use Canvas, when to use SVG" sidebar later in this chapter). As these applications are based on Open Web technology, they work in a browser on more devices, too. The Harmony application shown in Figure 5.3 even works on mobile devices, including the iPhone and Android phones.

The 2D API is large enough that I suspect we'll see entire books dedicated to the subject. Since I have only one chapter to talk about it, I'll primarily show you the basics. But I'll also include some of the funky stuff you can do with the canvas element, like capturing frames from a video or processing individual pixels from an image inside the canvas. I'll even show you how to export to files ready to be saved to your desktop. And I'll show you how to create your first animation, which might even hark back to the days of BASIC computing.
